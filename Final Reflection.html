	<p>
		I found this class to be very challenging and enlightening. It was nice to be able to put into practice, the many things that we learned the previous semester in Software Engineering Principles. I got to see software practices in action, which provided me with further insight on why and how they are used. Some of the most valuable lessons I've learned during this project are listed below.
	</p>
	<p><b>Teamwork</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Trust</b><br>
				Behind every successful project lies a well meshed team. Trusting your team members is the most important part of this. You have to have full trust that your team members will act as needed. If you don't, then you need to raise the issue and find a way to instill that much needed trust. One way we accomplished this is through an exercise from the "Five Dysfunctions" book, where everyone goes around and talks about their strength and weaknesses. This elicits their vulnerabilities, which in turn instills a sense of trust among one another. Trust is key, it helps lay the foundation for a well gelled team. 
			</li>
			<li> <b>Don't be a one man team</b><br> Do not think that you are a one man team, because that will never work. We had a couple meetings about 	a team member that we thougth was distancing himself from the team. We worked on ways to include him more and elicit more output from him. This helped in the long run because even though that member may not 	have been working as hard as he could, the remaining members came together to acknowledge it and found a solution. This way everyone was on the same page and came to a conclusion for a problem.
			</li>
			<li><b>Proper Collaboration</b><br>
				Figure out your team mates strengths and weaknesses, and use them to the projects advantage. If someone is good at documenation, and not that great at development, have that person focus on documentation. This will ensure that the team collaborates together to its fullest potential. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p><b>Trust your life-cycle model!</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			After we had adopted the Win Win Spiral Model, I have to admit, I had my doubts. I thought it would be the same as the regular spiral model. This was so false. We followed all the instructions for each phase and let it guide us. After the huge success of that first cycle, I became a beleiver. These models were created through years of trial and error and they DO work if you follow them correctly. Just put your faith into the model and you will a successful end result. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Don't worry about an unfinished product</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Our product did not fully meet our end goals of to correctly convert a TS file to an MP4 file. I was a little embarrassed at first because I really wanted to create this and impress our client. When we looked back at the win conditions of the stakeholders, they never mentioned having a fully completed product. So this made me feel better by knowing that our client did not expect us to be able to finish the product in the given amount of time we were given. So after realizing this, I felt much better. He never expected us to fully complete this in the first place because it is a very complicated program. I wasn’t managing my own expectations properly and should have done a better job at doing so. There is nothing wrong with having high expectations, but when they don’t work out, don’t worry about it.
		</li>
	</ul>
		<p><b>Don't waste time!</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			It's easy to be very lax in the beginning of the project, but once the deadline gets closer, you'll start to feel the stress. To counteract this, don't waste time in the beginning. If you finish a task early, see if you can help other team members. Not only will this help get things done quicker, but it will build chemistry between you. Don't overwork yourself though, as that can be detrimental to your success. If you have chosen proper timeframes for your tasks, then this shouldn't be an issue.
		</li>
	</ul>
