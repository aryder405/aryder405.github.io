<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Ts.go Code
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> This is all the code that Chris, Matt, Logan, and I created. This was done by porting the initial Python script that we received from Neill. This was later refactored by Matt. The main file in here is TS.go and it took the longest to complete. It is the class that contains the main function.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> This was the first major coding assignment that we completed. It was also the first time we did pair programming together. I found it very beneficial programming with Chris. He is very knowledgeable in areas that I am not. While working together he taught me useful ways to navigate and work in a linux environment. I mostly use Windows for school and work and have not had much exposure to linux systems. This alone was worth the pair programming for me. It was also beneficial because we were both new to the GO language and working together was much easier than trying to tackle this alone.
