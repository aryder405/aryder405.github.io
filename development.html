<!-- ********************  NEW ANNOTATION **********************-->
<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Ts.go Code
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> This is all the code that Chris, Matt, and I created. This was done by porting the initial Python script that we received from Neill. This was later refactored by Matt. The main file in here is TS.go and it took the longest to complete. It is the class that contains the main function.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> This was the first major coding assignment that we completed. It was also the first time we did pair programming together. I programmed with Chris and found it very beneficial. He is very knowledgeable in areas that I am not. While working together I learned new and useful ways to navigate and work in a linux environment. I mostly use Windows for school and work and have not had much exposure to linux systems. This alone was worth the pair programming for me. It was also beneficial because we were all new to the GO language and working together was much easier than trying to tackle this alone.

<!-- ********************  NEW ANNOTATION **********************-->
<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Driver.go Code
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> This is the code that Chris, Mat, and I created. We programmed this as a group in the library one day. This class is the main class in the program that interacts with the TS.go parser and the MP4 box builder. It is responsible for mapping the data from the TS file to the MP4 box builder.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> This programming assignment was very crucial to the overall project. Neill had put extra emphasis on creating the intermediary 'data structures' that would convert TS data to MP4 data. That's essentially what this class does. It was difficult to figure out what the data mappings were, but once we did, we started coding this. For this coding assignment, instead of pair programming, we did group programming. This was very fun for all of us because we got to see everyones strengths and weaknesses in the GO language. We all (Chris, Mat, and I) contributed during this assignment in various ways to get it done while the other group worked on the MP4 box builder.

<!-- ********************  NEW ANNOTATION **********************-->
<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> GiftCollection.go Code
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> This class was created after we had created Driver.go. This was coded by everyone on the team. This class takes information from driver.go and builds the necessary boxes that are needed to construct an MP4.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> After the success of the group programming assignment that we did to create driver.go, we decided to try it again to build giftCollection.go. This time was not as enjoyable as the previous time because there were too many people. This compounded the message pathways that were available and just caused too much confusion in my own opinion. I found myself having to mediate a lot during this session because we kept getting off track. It was a good experiment, but in the end I would not suggest a group coding session for a group of more than three people. Unless of course they were coding different aspects of the program. We were all trying to code one class that we thought was going to be fairly straight forward, but in fact turned out to be more complicated than we had anticipated.
