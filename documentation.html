<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Moof.py class diagram </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a class diagram of the moof.py script. It also includes data.py, which is much smaller.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	This was my first attempt at modeling a class. The class diagram can be helpful when trying to understand how it works. I made this because at the time, we needed to understand the script at a higher level. Instead of delving into all the functional details of the script that might be hard to understand, I started at a higher level and just mapped out the classes, the variables, and functions. It gave us a better understanding of the script, which then helped us understand all the functional details at a future time.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Ts.go data flow diagram
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a data flow diagram of the functional design of the ts.go parser. This was delivered with the ts.go code as functional documentation.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I made this diagram with the help of Chris, and used Visio as the software to create it. I enjoyed using Visio and have used it ever since to create any diagrams. The data flow diagram gives a much more in depth representation of how this mp2 parser program works. It took a while to create because of the complexities of the ts parser program, and forced us to delve deeper into the program which in turn made us more knowledgeable of how it worked.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> TS to MP4 mapping diagram
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a diagram that I created with the help of everyone’s input on the different aspects. This was the result of one of our cycles where the objective was to understand how the PCR timestamps on the TS correlate to the timing of the MP4 samples.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During the making of this diagram, we made some critical breakthroughs for our understanding of how we will use the PCR timestamps in the MP4. This was very good for our team because it was one of the specific win conditions that our client, Neill had mentioned.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Tentative Schedule 
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a schedule that I created during the beginning of the project. The purpose of this schedule was to make people aware of the time scale of our project and how we could best plan out our iterations and presentations. The making of this schedule actually showed us how we were following our spiral model incorrectly and lead us into re-thinking our model and ultimately adopting the win-win spiral model.</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	The reason I’m including this artifact is not because it was a good schedule that we followed and adhered to. It is because the creation of this schedule actually made us realize that we were not following the spiral model correctly. When I created this schedule, we were planning out how we were going to finish this product and therefore we planned out an iteration for each 3 major objective that we had. This way of thinking is not correct when following an agile process model because you have no idea of when each iteration will start or end. Dr. Paul noticed this immediately and enlightened us that we were not following an agile process model by planning out three iterations based upon our three major objectives. This is more of a waterfall approach to plan out an entire project. For me personally, this is what gave me greatest insight to agile versus waterfall type models. This led our team to adopt the win-win spiral model and I am very glad that we did because we have really enjoyed it and have all had the pleasure of experiencing how well the win-win spiral model can handle the creation of software models.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model Template </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a representation of the Win Win Spiral model, with annotation boxes for each phase that can be used to describe what your team did to complete that phase.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I was really looking for some way to keep track of each phase that our team completed. At first we used a simple bulleted format to describe each phase and how we completed them. This worked for a while but I felt there was a better way we could show the model itself while also showing our steps for each phase. So I drew a win win spiral model up in Visio and added annotation boxes for each phase. Everyone really liked it, so we adopted this as our main way to document our iterations. The only issue with this is that you have to have Visio to edit the annotation boxes.
