<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Moof.py class diagram </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a class diagram of the moof.py script. It also includes data.py, which is much smaller.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	This was my first attempt at modeling a class. The class diagram can be helpful when trying to understand how it works. I made this because at the time, we needed to understand the script at a higher level. Instead of delving into all the functional details of the script that might be hard to understand, I started at a higher level and just mapped out the classes, the variables, and functions. It gave us a better understanding of the script, which then helped us understand all the functional details at a future time.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Ts.go data flow diagram
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a data flow diagram of the functional design of the ts.go parser. This was delivered with the ts.go code as functional documentation.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I made this diagram with the help of Chris, and used Visio as the software to create it. I enjoyed using Visio and have used it ever since to create any diagrams. The data flow diagram gives a much more in depth representation of how this mp2 parser program works. It took a while to create because of the complexities of the ts parser program, and forced us to delve deeper into the program which in turn made us more knowledgeable of how it worked.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> TS to MP4 mapping diagram
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a diagram that I created with the help of everyone’s input on the different aspects. This was the result of one of our cycles where the objective was to understand how the PCR timestamps on the TS correlate to the timing of the MP4 samples.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During the making of this diagram, we made some critical breakthroughs for our understanding of how we will use the PCR timestamps in the MP4. This was very good for our team because it was one of the specific win conditions that our client, Neill had mentioned.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Tentative Schedule 
</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a schedule that I created during the beginning of the project. The purpose of this schedule was to make people aware of the time scale of our project and how we could best plan out our iterations and presentations. The making of this schedule actually showed us how we were following our spiral model incorrectly and lead us into re-thinking our model and ultimately adopting the win-win spiral model.</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	The reason I’m including this artifact is not because it was a good schedule that we followed and adhered to. It is because the creation of this schedule was one of the reasons that made us realize we were not following the spiral model correctly. When I created this schedule, we were planning out how we were going to finish this product and therefore we planned out an iteration for each 3 major objective that we had. This way of thinking is not correct when following an agile process model because you have no idea of when each iteration will start or end. Dr. Paul noticed this immediately and enlightened us that we were not following an agile process model by planning out three iterations based upon our three major objectives. This is more of a waterfall approach to plan out an entire project. For me personally, this is what gave me greatest insight to agile versus waterfall type models. This is not the main reason, but it is one of the few reasons that led our team to adopt the win-win spiral model. I am very glad that we adopted the win win model because we have really enjoyed it and have all had the pleasure of experiencing how well the win-win spiral model can handle the risk management of producing successful software.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model Template </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a representation of the Win Win Spiral model, with annotation boxes for each phase that can be used to describe what your team did to complete that phase.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I was really looking for some way to keep track of each phase that our team completed. At first we used a simple bulleted format to describe each phase and how we completed them. This worked for a while but I felt there was a better way we could show the model itself while also showing our steps for each phase. So I drew a win win spiral model up in Visio and added annotation boxes for each phase. Everyone really liked it, so we adopted this as our main way to document our iterations. The only issue with this is that you have to have Visio to edit the annotation boxes.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Project Management </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This artifact is of our github page. This is the tool that we used to manage our project.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	We chose to use github as the tool for our project management. The reasons for this is mostly because we were all already familiar with the software and we didn’t think that we would need something fancy. I personally started to question this decision midway through the semester after seeing one of the other groups’ software management system. Github just doesn’t have the functionality that a lot of other systems have. Even though github doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that some other systems have, I think it worked for our team. We mostly used it as a repository for the code, which worked great. We also used the wiki pages to keep track of important information and documentation. Other than that, we never really used to the issue tracker. The issue tracker actually seemed more of a hindrance than an advantage when we did use it. The way we kept track of our tasks for everyone was through meetings and emails. We would have a meeting every 2-3 days either in person, or virtually. After these meetings, we would assign tasks to everyone and would make sure that everyone understood these tasks. Being such a small group, we always knew what everyone else should be working on, along with ourselves. We would also send out an email with the tasks after every meeting. Now this good for us, but what if one of our stakeholders wanted to know exactly what we were doing at a certain point in time without having to talk to us? Well he wouldn’t be able to obtain that information himself. This is where a task tracking system would be beneficial. However, our stakeholders had never expressed to us that they wanted to have this feature available to them, so therefore we never looked into anything better than github. Github’s simple functionality suited our teams’ needs just fine.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Client Communication </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This an artifact that contains all the emails we had with our client, Neill.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	Our interactions and communications with our client were very sparse. Neill said from the start that he would be very busy and most likely be limited to one communication per week. We would email him after every cycle for his approval and committal to the next cycle. Sometimes he would respond, and sometimes he would not. When he did respond, it was a short response mainly stating that we were on the right track and to keep doing what we were doing. We took these statements as approval and committal to the next cycles.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> First Client Meeting </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	These are the pictures and notes from our first client meeting.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	 I went into this meeting, not really knowing what to expect. My main focus was on requirements gathering. Neill made this pretty easy for us by referring to the requirements as ‘bullets on the box’. These were basically, bullet points of specific requirements that he desired. These requirements became our main goal, which led us to incorrectly follow our spiral model. He also stated how he would like the program coded in the GO language as Comcast will be making a push for this language in their future projects. After the meeting we decided to use the GO language and to also use Github as our management tool. We should have thought this through more because we were acting as if Neill was our only stakeholder in the project. We didn’t recognize Dr. Paul or ourselves really as stakeholders at this point. We were only concerned in meeting Neill’s expectations. This line of thought hindered our ability to properly use the spiral model.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> First Win-Win Spiral Meeting</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This was the first meeting we had after deciding to move from the original spiral model and adopt the win-win spiral model.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During class, after Dr. Paul’s advisement, we realized that we were not following the spiral model correctly. We were planning out future cycles before the current one was even completed. This is not agile and is more of a waterfall approach. So we decided to adopt the win-win spiral after consulting with Dr. Paul. After class we went to the library and started to design our win-win spiral model. We started by identifying all stakeholders and also each of their win conditions. If there were any conflicting win conditions, we had to reconcile them. This made the next steps much easier, which was to declare our objectives. The objectives should stem from the set of reconciled win conditions and they were much easier to identify this way. We made a lot of progress during this meeting and we all learned the benefits of the win-win spiral model over the original spiral model.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Team Building</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a summary of our team building exercises. (No artifact)
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	The first couple weeks of the project, we focused mainly on team building. We did this by going out to dinner, having some drinks and just socializing with each other. I had personally worked with everyone in my group before in previous classes, so we were all very well acquainted. We still participated in some team building exercises though. First we went around in a circle and said what we thing our strength and weaknesses were. We also talked about our families and personal lives. This helped each of us get to know each other on a more personal level, which would hopefully open our vulnerabilities to everyone and thus building on our trust foundation.</p>

<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the breakdown of hours that I personally contributed to for this project.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I ended up doing a lot of documentation for this project, more than anything else. I always volunteered to do the documentation because I thought I had a well enough understanding of the issues that I could properly convey them. One thing that suprised me was how many hours we spent in meetings.
