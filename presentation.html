<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model presentation </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the Prezi that we presented to the class on 3/6.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	Our presentation stemmed from the production of an experimental Prezi that I created. After I showed everyone the Prezi I created, they all seemed to like it, so we decided to use it as a presentation platform. We all picked out parts that we would like to talk about, which was broken into phases of our win win spiral model. I was tasked with talking about phase 3, which is win condition reconciliation, objectives, alternatives and constraints. This phase of the model is one of the most important phases in the whole model because this is where we decide what our objectives for the iteration will be. These objectives stem from the set of reconciled win conditions. I had to do a lot of thinking to be able to articulate this process correctly. I now feel like i have a much better understanding of this process and why it is so important. This phase is not in the regular spiral model because the regular spiral model does not take into account explicit win conditions of stakeholders. When we create our objectives in this phase, we know that they will directly satisfy our stakeholders win conditions, thus minimizing our risks.
	Over all I think the presentation went well. Some things we should do next time is to find a way for the speaker to execute the slides instead of someone else. Even though we did practice the presentation, it was hard to know when the speaker was done talking and wanted to move on to the next slide. Another thing is that we did not explicitly define some of the subjects of talk. Most importantly, what a Moof or TS was. If we are going to talk about something, then we should make sure the audience understands what it is.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Presentation #1 speech </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the speech that I wrote prior to our presentation. 
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I spent about 5 hours writing up a speech and practicing it and I must say that my insight into the win-win spiral model was increased. I tried to say everything I wrote, but nervousness conquered my memory and I did end up leaving stuff out.
	During the writing of this speech, I started to understand the win win spiral model much better. I wanted to articulate these ideas to the class and in doing I myself became much more knowledgeable of the model and its’ phases. I read a lot of different information from different sources online to prepare for the speech. I had prior knowledge of what the win-win spiral model was, but it wasn’t until this time that I really understood why the win-win spiral model is so much better than the normal model. Having to present this to the class and articulate it in a way that would be easy for the audience to understand required a lot of thinking and research. During this preparation, I started to fully understand all the core concepts of the win-win spiral model, and why they are used. The major differences between the two models is that the regular spiral model just starts out at determining your objectives but it never addresses how you got those objectives. The win-win starts out by identifying stakeholders and their respective win conditions. You then reconcile these win conditions to a set of mutually satisfactory set of win conditions for everyone involved. The objectives then stem from these win conditions. That is the difference between the two models. The benefit is that you know you're starting with objectives that will satisfy ALL stakeholders' win conditions. By doing this you are minimizing the risk of failure. Thus establishing a proper risk driven model.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Presentation #2 </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the outline of the presentation that we created, along with pictures of the props that were used.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	This presentation was not a conventional presentation. This was more of a hybrid between a lecture and a demonstration. We wanted to really educate the class on how the TS and MP4 files were structured. We thought about using slides, but couldn't figure out how to properly represent all aspects of the files. A 3D animation would of been the preferable way to represent how these structures work, but none of us are familiar with animation development. So we figured a live animation using props would be the next best option. What better way to represent mp4 boxes, with none other than actual tangible boxes? 
	Materials used for this presentation:
	Yellow sticky tape to represent the transport stream.
	Cardboard boxes to represent mp4 boxes.
	Sugar packets to represent PES packets.
	Plastic bag to represent a sample, which contains all the sugar packets.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Presentation #2 speech </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the outline of the speech that I followed during our second presentation.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	This presentation was quite different than the other ones, and we didn’t get a chance to all practice presenting together. So a lot of the things that I wanted to say just didn’t get said mostly because it wasn’t coordinated properly with Chris (whom I was presenting with).

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Presentation #3 </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	The presentation outline for our third presentation.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	This presentation stemmed from our second client meeting when Neill listed off desirable skills that a graduating CS student should have. We wanted to share these details with our fellow students because we thought it was information that we all should know. This by itself was not enough for the whole team to present on so we also added a technical overview of the GO language. Our fellow students had shown interest in the language and had even agreed that a presentation would be helpful for them. So we decided to marry the two subjects together into one presentation. There really wasn't much information between the two subjects for six people to talk about so Andrew and I agreed to do the introduction and conclusion. I did the conclusion and attempted to wrap everything up nicely for the class.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Presentation #3 Speech  </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is the outline of the speech for our third presentation.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	For this presentation I was tasked with the conclusion. In the conclusion I reviewed what Neill had stated as desirable skills for a graduating senior. After that I also talked briefly about how to find a job in the CS industry. I did feel more comfortable speaking in front of everyone, which was a pleasant surprise because I usually get very nervous when speaking in front of a crowd.
