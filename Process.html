<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Spiral Model Generator </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	We initially used the Spiral Model Generator as our life-cycle model, but adopted the Win Win model after.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	As we were initially planning what life cycle model we would be following, we wanted to pick something that we were familiar with and that was also agile. We chose the spiral model generator because we had used it before and thought it would best suit our needs. An agile model would best suit our different time schedules and would allow us to get the most amount of work done in the 16 week time frame. The ever-adapting agile framework would also cater to the busy schedule of our client and manage our risk properly. I thought we were doing great when we planned our first cycle, but I had fallen into the spiral vortex of deceit of our outdated model.</p>
<p class="annotation">	 Our first mistake came when we chose our objectives for our first major cycle. This objective was to design our own TS parser, based on the python script that Neill gave us. This was a mistake because we were not acting upon our stakeholders current win conditions. However, they were based on over all win conditions, but not the current win conditions. One thing that we overlooked, was our credibility. We needed to produce some working tangible code for our client to prove our credibility, and this current objective of "Designing a ts parser" was not going to meet that win condition. Our mistake was noticed by Dr. Paul and explained to us, we then accepted defeat and began to plan a cycle with the win win spiral model.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	For our life-cycle model, we used the Win-Win Spiral Model
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	We didn't plan on using the win win spiral model at first. We originally had used the regular spiral model, and it's
	inadequacies forced us to find a more suitable model to follow. I personally found the win win spiral model to be much easier to understand and follow than its' predecessor. The win win model has three additional phases that precurse the regular spiral model. They begin with identifying the stakeholders, and then identifying those stakeholders' win conditions. This part is crucial and is the key part that differs from the regular spiral model. Once you know what everyone’s win conditions are, you have to reconcile any win conditions that are in conflict. Once you have a set of reconciled win conditions you can then choose your objectives. This process that I've stated is the key difference between the win win model and the regular model. It answers the question of "Where do these objectives come from, and how do we know that they are valid?". The regular model does not answer this question, as it just starts out choosing objectives.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> First Win-Win Spiral Meeting</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This was the first meeting we had after deciding to move from the original spiral model and adopt the win-win spiral model.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During class, after Dr. Paul’s advisement, we realized that we were not following the spiral model correctly. One of the reasons was that we were planning our future cycles before the current one was even completed. This is not agile and is more of a waterfall approach. So we decided to adopt the win-win spiral after consulting with Dr. Paul. After class we went to the library and started to design our win-win spiral model. We started by identifying all stakeholders and also each of their win conditions. If there were any conflicting win conditions, we had to reconcile them. This made the next steps much easier, which was to declare our objectives. The objectives should stem from the set of reconciled win conditions and they were much easier to identify this way. We made a lot of progress during this meeting and we all learned the benefits of the win-win spiral model over the original spiral model.
