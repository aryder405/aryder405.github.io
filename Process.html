<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Spiral Model Generator </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	We initially used the Spiral Model Generator as our life-cycle model, but adopted the Win Win model afterwords.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	As we were initially planning what life cycle model we would be following, we wanted to pick something that we were familiar with and that was also agile. We chose the spiral model generator because we had used it before and thought it would best suit our needs. An agile model would best suit our different time schedules and would allow us to get the most amount of work done in the 16 week time frame. The ever-adapting agile framework would also cater to the busy schedule of our client and manage our risk properly. I thought we were doing great when we planned our first cycle, but I had fallen into the spiral vortex of deceit of our out-dated model.</p>
<p class="annotation">	 Our first mistake came when we chose our objectives for our first major cycle. This objective was to design our own TS parser, based on the python script that Neill gave us. This was a mistake because we were not acting upon our stakeholders current win conditions. However, they were based on over all win conditions, but not the current win conditions. One thing that we overlooked, was our credibility. We needed to produce some working tangible code for our client to prove our credibility, and this current objective of "Designing a ts parser" was not going to meet that win condition. Our mistake was noticed by Dr. Paul and explained to us, we then accepted defeat and began to plan a cycle with the win win spiral model.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	For our life-cycle model, we used the Win-Win Spiral Model
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	We didn't plan on using the win win spiral model at first. We originally had used the regular spiral model, and it's
	inadequacies forced us to find a more suitable model to follow. I personally found the win win spiral model to be much easier to understand and follow than its' predecessor. The win win model has three additional phases that precurse the regular spiral model. They begin with identifying the stakeholders, and then identifying those stakeholders' win conditions. This part is crucial and is the key part that differs from the regular spiral model. Once you know what everyones win conditions are, you have to reconcile any win conditions that are in conflict. Once you have a set of reconciled win conditions you can then choose your objectives. This process that I've stated is the key difference between the win win model and the regular model. It answers the question of "Where do these objectives come from, and how do we know that they are valid?". The regular model does not answer this question, as it just starts out choosing objectives.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model Template </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a representation of the Win Win Spiral model, with annotation boxes for each phase that can be used to describe what your team did to complete that phase.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I was really looking for some way to keep track of each phase that our team completed. At first we used a simple bulleted format to describe each phase and how we completed them. This worked for a while but I felt there was a better way we could show the model itself while also showing our steps for each phase. So I drew a win win spiral model up in Visio and added annotation boxes for each phase. Everyone really liked it, so we adopted this as our main way to document our iterations. The only issue with this is that you have to have Visio to edit the annotation boxes.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Project Management </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This artifact is of our github page. This is the tool that we used to manage our project.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	We chose to use github as the tool for our project management. The reasons for this is mostly because we were all already familiar with the software and we didn’t think that we would need something fancy. I personally started to question this decision midway through the semester after seeing one of the other groups’ software management system. Github just doesn’t have the functionality that a lot of other systems have. Even though github doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that some other systems have, I think it worked for our team. We mostly used it as a repository for the code, which worked great. We also used the wiki pages to keep track of important information and documentation. Other than that, we never really used to the issue tracker. The issue tracker actually seemed more of a hindrance than an advantage when we did use it. The way we kept track of our tasks for everyone was through meetings and emails. We would have a meeting every 2-3 days either in person, or virtually. After these meetings, we would assign tasks to everyone and would make sure that everyone understood these tasks. Being such a small group, we always knew what everyone else should be working on, along with ourselves. We would also send out an email with the tasks after every meeting. Now this good for us, but what if one of our stakeholders wanted to know exactly what we were doing at a certain point in time without having to talk to us? Well he wouldn’t be able to obtain that information himself. This is where a task tracking system would be beneficial. However, our stakeholders had never expressed to us that they wanted to have this feature available to them, so therefore we never looked into anything better than github. Github’s simple functionality suited our teams’ needs just fine.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> First Win-Win Spiral Meeting</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This was the first meeting we had after deciding to move from the original spiral model and adopt the win-win spiral model.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During class, after Dr. Paul’s advisement, we realized that we were not following the spiral model correctly. We were planning out future cycles before the current one was even completed. This is not agile and is more of a waterfall approach. So we decided to adopt the win-win spiral after consulting with Dr. Paul. After class we went to the library and started to design our win-win spiral model. We started by identifying all stakeholders and also each of their win conditions. If there were any conflicting win conditions, we had to reconcile them. This made the next steps much easier, which was to declare our objectives. The objectives should stem from the set of reconciled win conditions and they were much easier to identify this way. We made a lot of progress during this meeting and we all learned the benefits of the win-win spiral model over the original spiral model.
