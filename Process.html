<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Win win spiral model Template </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This is a representation of the Win Win Spiral model, with annotation boxes for each phase that can be used to describe what your team did to complete that phase.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	I was really looking for some way to keep track of each phase that our team completed. At first we used a simple bulleted format to describe each phase and how we completed them. This worked for a while but I felt there was a better way we could show the model itself while also showing our steps for each phase. So I drew a win win spiral model up in Visio and added annotation boxes for each phase. Everyone really liked it, so we adopted this as our main way to document our iterations. The only issue with this is that you have to have Visio to edit the annotation boxes.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> Project Management </p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This artifact is of our github page. This is the tool that we used to manage our project.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	We chose to use github as the tool for our project management. The reasons for this is mostly because we were all already familiar with the software and we didn’t think that we would need something fancy. I personally started to question this decision midway through the semester after seeing one of the other groups’ software management system. Github just doesn’t have the functionality that a lot of other systems have. Even though github doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that some other systems have, I think it worked for our team. We mostly used it as a repository for the code, which worked great. We also used the wiki pages to keep track of important information and documentation. Other than that, we never really used to the issue tracker. The issue tracker actually seemed more of a hindrance than an advantage when we did use it. The way we kept track of our tasks for everyone was through meetings and emails. We would have a meeting every 2-3 days either in person, or virtually. After these meetings, we would assign tasks to everyone and would make sure that everyone understood these tasks. Being such a small group, we always knew what everyone else should be working on, along with ourselves. We would also send out an email with the tasks after every meeting. Now this good for us, but what if one of our stakeholders wanted to know exactly what we were doing at a certain point in time without having to talk to us? Well he wouldn’t be able to obtain that information himself. This is where a task tracking system would be beneficial. However, our stakeholders had never expressed to us that they wanted to have this feature available to them, so therefore we never looked into anything better than github. Github’s simple functionality suited our teams’ needs just fine.

<p class="annotation"> <b>Title:</b> First Win-Win Spiral Meeting</p>		
<p class="annotation"> <b>Description:</b> 
	This was the first meeting we had after deciding to move from the original spiral model and adopt the win-win spiral model.
</p>
<p class="annotation"> <b>Reflection:</b> 
	During class, after Dr. Paul’s advisement, we realized that we were not following the spiral model correctly. We were planning out future cycles before the current one was even completed. This is not agile and is more of a waterfall approach. So we decided to adopt the win-win spiral after consulting with Dr. Paul. After class we went to the library and started to design our win-win spiral model. We started by identifying all stakeholders and also each of their win conditions. If there were any conflicting win conditions, we had to reconcile them. This made the next steps much easier, which was to declare our objectives. The objectives should stem from the set of reconciled win conditions and they were much easier to identify this way. We made a lot of progress during this meeting and we all learned the benefits of the win-win spiral model over the original spiral model.
